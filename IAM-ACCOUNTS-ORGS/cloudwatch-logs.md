# Cloudwatch Logs

CloudWatch Logs is a public service which can accept logging data, store it and monitor it.

It is often the default place where AWS Services can output their logging too.

CloudWatch Logs is a public service and can also be utilised in an on-premises environment and even from other public cloud platforms.

AWS services integrate automatically with Cloudwatch Logs, and external services can integrate using the unified Cloudwatch agent.

You can generate metrics based on logs - called a **metric filter**

CWL is a *regional service*.
